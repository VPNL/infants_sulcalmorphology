**Infant Sulcal Morphology**

This repository contains the code and data for the paper: **"How infant brains fold: Sulcal deepening is linked to development of sulcal span, thickness, curvature, and microstructure."** Tung, S.S., Yan, X., Fascendini, B., Tyagi, C., Reyes, C.M., Ducre, K., Perez, K., Allen, A., Horenziak, J., Wu, H., Keil, B., Natu, V.S., Grill-Spector, K. (2025).

The repository is organized as follows:

``code/``: Contains analysis scripts for each figure in the paper
- MATLAB scripts for all figures except Figure 4B
- R script for Figure 4B

``data/``: Contains the necessary data files (in CSV format) to run each analysis
- Data files are organized by figure number for easy reference

**Requirements**
- MATLAB
- R

**Dependencies**

MATLAB Version: Code was written and tested using MATLAB R2023a, but it should be compatible with both older and more recent MATLAB versions.

Optional Tools: If you wish to process your own raw data using the scripts (e.g., from NIfTI files), you will need to install Vistasoft, a MATLAB toolbox for neuroimaging data analysis.
